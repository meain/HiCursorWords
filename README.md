# HiCursorWords MOD #

----------

## About ##

This script highlights words under the cursor like many IDEs.

This doesn't provide scope-aware highlighting nor language specific one.
You can control highlighting by highlighting group names.

## Configuration ##

**highlight group:**

Highlight group has not been set, set this in your `vimrc`:

	highlight WordUnderTheCursor ctermbg=238 guibg=#444444

You can change it to what you want.


**default config:**
	
	let g:HiCursorWords_delay = 200
	let g:HiCursorWords_hiGroupRegexp = ''
	let g:HiCursorWords_debugEchoHiName = 0

**Variables explanation:**

(A right hand side value is a default value.)

	g:HiCursorWords_delay = 200

A delay for highlighting in milliseconds.
Smaller value may cause your machine slow down.

 	g:HiCursorWords_hiGroupRegexp = ''
If empty, all words are highlighted.
If not empty, only the specified highlight group is highlighted.
(my memo: 'Identifier\|vimOperParen')

To investigate highlight group name, the next variable may help you.

	g:HiCursorWords_debugEchoHiName = 0
If not 0, echoes the highlight group name under the cursor. 


## Installation details ##
Just put this file into the **plugin** directory.

That's all. Have fun `/*_*/`
